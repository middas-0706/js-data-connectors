/**
 * A storage used ONLY for live-test runs. Instead of writing to a real
 * destination, it prints each record to stdout as a marker-prefixed NDJSON
 * line so the spawning process can collect a sample.
 *
 * This must implement the WHOLE storage surface AbstractConnector calls, not
 * the part the happy path happens to hit. A live test is not a mock harness:
 * connector-runner hands the real AbstractConnector this class as its
 * StorageClass, so any method the connector calls and this class lacks is a
 * crash in the one run that is supposed to prove a manifest works before it is
 * published. That surface is closed and small -- grep `storage.` in
 * AbstractConnector.js -- and is, in full:
 *
 *   constructor(context, uniqueKeys, fields, description)      getStorageForNode
 *   init()                                                     _writeBatch
 *   saveData(data)                                             _writeBatch
 *   replaceData(data)                                          processFullRefreshNode
 *
 * Everything else on AbstractStorage (getColumnType, getSelectedFields,
 * saveRecordsAddedToBuffer, hasSameSchema, ...) is called by storages on
 * themselves, never by the connector, so it has nothing to do here.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT extend AbstractStorage, for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. It would not help. Every method AbstractStorage leaves unimplemented
 *     throws -- its replaceData() throws "does not support full-refresh table
 *     replacement" -- so inheriting would trade "replaceData is not a function"
 *     for a different exception on the same line, not fix it. Only an actual
 *     implementation makes the live test work.
 *  2. It would break the case that needs it most. AbstractStorage's constructor
 *     throws when uniqueKeyColumns is empty, and a full-refresh node replaces
 *     its whole table and so declares no unique key (DeclarativeSource defaults
 *     uniqueKeys to []). It also calls context.registerParameters(), which this
 *     class is constructed too cheaply to depend on.
