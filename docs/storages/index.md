# Storages

A **Storage** is your project's data warehouse — a SQL-compatible system where all your data lives. Examples include Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and AWS Athena.

## What Storages do in OWOX

Every [Data Mart](../data-marts/) runs on a Storage. Connectors load raw data into it, SQL Data Marts query it, and Reports read from it. OWOX Data Marts never retains your data. It stays in your warehouse, under your ownership and control.

Each project needs at least one Storage. You can add several Storages to isolate clients or teams. Each Data Mart links to exactly one Storage.

## How Storages fit the workflow

[Sources](../connectors/) import raw data into a Storage. [Data Marts](../data-marts/) define business-ready data on top of it. [Destinations](../destinations/) and [Reports](../reports/) deliver that data to business users.
