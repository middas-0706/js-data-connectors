 * dismissed while the request runs. Focus goes back to whatever opened it, or to
 * `fallbackFocus` when that element left with the plugin it belonged to.
 *
 * Takes `uninstall` rather than calling usePluginActions itself, so a surface that already
 * holds the plugin actions does not start a second set of mutations.
