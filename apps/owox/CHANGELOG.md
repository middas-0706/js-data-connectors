# owox

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d83d7c: # Add configurable timeout middleware for long-running operations
  - Increase server timeout from 2 minutes to 3 minutes (180s) to prevent timeout errors
  - Add operation-specific timeout middleware for data mart operations:
    - SQL editing operations: 3 minutes timeout
    - Schema operations: 3 minutes timeout
    - Publishing operations: 3 minutes timeout
    - All other operations: 30 seconds timeout (default)
  - Update frontend timeout configuration for specific operations to 3 minutes
  - Prevent race conditions in timeout middleware by ensuring only one timeout per request
  - Add proper cleanup and error handling in timeout middleware

  This change fixes timeout issues for long-running operations like SQL editing, schema refresh, and data mart publishing while maintaining reasonable timeouts for other operations.
