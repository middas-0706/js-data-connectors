# Notification Settings

Notification Settings let you control when and how your team gets notified about Data Mart runs — by email, webhook, or both.

Each project has its own set of notification settings, one per notification type. Settings are created automatically the first time a run occurs in the project.

## Notification Types

| Type | Default | Triggered when |
|---|---|---|
| **Failed runs** | Enabled | One or more Data Mart runs fail within the grouping window |
| **Successful runs** | Disabled | One or more Data Mart runs complete successfully within the grouping window |

## Configuring a Notification

Click on a notification row to open its settings.

### Enable / Disable

Use the toggle to turn a notification on or off. When disabled, no emails or webhooks are sent regardless of other settings.

### Receivers

Receivers are project members who will receive email notifications. Select one or more members from the list.

> ☝️ A member will only receive emails if their account has email notifications enabled. Members with notifications disabled are shown with a warning badge.

#### Automatic Subscription

When a new member joins the project with an **Admin** or **Data Owner** role, they are automatically added as a receiver to all existing notification settings. This also applies to members who previously left the project and have been re-added.

If a member manually removes themselves from the receivers list (via the UI), they will **not** be re-subscribed automatically — their choice is respected as long as they remain in the project.

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| New Admin/Data Owner joins the project | Automatically subscribed |
| Member leaves the project and returns as Admin/Data Owner | Automatically subscribed (treated as new) |
| Admin/Data Owner manually unsubscribes via the UI | Stays unsubscribed |
| Member's role changes from Business User to Data Owner | Automatically subscribed |
| Member's role changes from Data Owner to Business User | Removed from receivers |

#### Role-Based Cleanup

Members whose role is downgraded to **Business User** are automatically removed from the receivers list, since only Admins and Data Owners are eligible to receive notifications. Similarly, members who are removed from the project entirely are cleaned up from the receivers list.

### Grouping Delay

The **Grouping Delay** controls how often notifications are batched and sent.

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| 5 minutes | Runs are grouped and sent every 5 minutes |
| 15 minutes | Runs are grouped and sent every 15 minutes |
| 30 minutes | Runs are grouped and sent every 30 minutes |
| **1 hour** *(default)* | Runs are grouped and sent every hour |
| 2 hours | Runs are grouped and sent every 2 hours |
| 6 hours | Runs are grouped and sent every 6 hours |
| 12 hours | Runs are grouped and sent every 12 hours |
| 24 hours | Runs are grouped and sent once a day |

> ☝️ Instead of sending a separate notification for every single run, OWOX batches all runs within the window into one message. This keeps your inbox clean on busy projects.

### Webhook URL

Optionally, you can send a webhook to any HTTP endpoint. See [Webhooks](./webhooks.md) for the payload format and setup instructions.
