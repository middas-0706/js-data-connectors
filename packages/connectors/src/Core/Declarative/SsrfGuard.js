// NOTE: node:dns/promises is loaded through a LAZY DYNAMIC import, deliberately,
// and must not be converted back to a top-level `import ... from`.
//
// The connector bundle is assembled by ConnectorBuilder.processEntityFile
// (vite.config.js), which concatenates every Core file into a single scope and
// STRIPS every line starting with `import`. SsrfGuard is the only Core file that
// imports a node builtin, so a static import here silently vanished from dist/
// and left `dnsLookup(...)` referencing nothing. The resulting ReferenceError
// was swallowed by _assertResolvesToPublic's former bare catch, which failed
// OPEN -- so in the SHIPPED BUNDLE the resolve-and-validate check never ran at
// all, while every unit test (importing this ESM source directly) stayed green.
//
// A dynamic import is not at the start of a line, so the stripper leaves it
// alone, and source and bundle now execute the exact same path.
//
// `redactUrl` is a different case and a STATIC import is correct for it: it is a
// Core file, so the bundler concatenates its (hoisted) declaration into the same
// scope and stripping this line leaves the call resolving fine — the same way
// every other Declarative file reaches Core symbols.

/**
 * Network egress boundary for declarative connectors. Every outbound URL the
 * Requester builds is validated here: scheme must be https, host must be on the
 * manifest-declared allowlist, and neither the literal host NOR any address it
 * resolves to may be a private, loopback, or link-local target (cloud metadata
 * at 169.254.169.254).
 *
 * DNS resolve-and-validate (assertAllowed/assertPublicHttps are async) closes the
 * static "public-hostname → internal-IP" DNS-rebinding vector: after the literal
 * checks pass, the host is resolved (all A/AAAA) and the request is rejected if
 * ANY resolved address is blocked.
 *
 * RESIDUAL (deferred): this validates the addresses resolved HERE, but the
 * subsequent fetch re-resolves the host independently, so a sub-second TTL rebind
 * between this check and connect is still theoretically possible. Full
 * anti-rebinding requires pinning the connection to the pre-validated IP at
 * socket-connect time (an undici Agent `connect.lookup` dispatcher). `undici` is
 * not a direct dependency of this package, so connection-time IP-pinning is
 * intentionally NOT implemented here; the manual per-hop re-validation in
 * AbstractSource.urlFetchWithRetry (redirects) plus this resolve-check cover the
 * practical cases.
