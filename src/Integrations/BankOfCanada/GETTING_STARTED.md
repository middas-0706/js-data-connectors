## How to Import Data from the Bank of Canada Source

To receive data from the Bank of Canada source, start by making a copy of the following template:
- [**Bank of Canada. Template**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yHHAUhH9OeFoIULGDmWUSAkfVmjb8eY4XeHzbYvu14s/copy). 

Fill in the required **Start Date**.

The import process is complete when the Log data displays **"Import is finished"**. Your data will appear in the **Data** tab.
