/**
 * Packs the workspaces the container image installs into tarballs.
 *
 * The image used to run `npm install -g owox@<version>`, which meant a build
 * could only start once npm was serving every package of that version. For
 * `@owox/backend` that took between eight and sixteen minutes after a
 * successful publish -- its packument carries well over a thousand snapshot
 * versions -- so the build kept failing with `ETARGET No matching version
 * found` while the registry caught up.
 *
 * Packing here removes the registry from the critical path. On the release
 * path it is also the same artifact by construction, since `npm publish`
 * uploads what `npm pack` produces -- though nothing verifies that, and on the
 * snapshot path there is no published artifact to be the same as.
 *
 * Only what `owox` pulls in at runtime is packed, so the image keeps the
 * contents it has today. `@owox/ctl`, `@owox/plugin-sdk` and `@owox/api-client`
 * are published but nothing in `owox` reaches them, and packing them would add
 * binaries the image never had.
 *
 * This script does NOT build anything. Five of the eight packed workspaces have
 * no `prepack` that produces their `dist` -- they rely on the build step that
 * runs before this one -- so it asserts the output exists rather than trusting
 * the caller. Run `npm run build --workspace owox` first.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/pack-owox-image-packages.mjs [output-dir]
