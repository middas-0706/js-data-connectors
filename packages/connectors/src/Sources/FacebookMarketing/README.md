# Facebook Ads Source

Use this connector to import Facebook Ads data into your data warehouse.

You can:

- Land raw Facebook Ads data in your own warehouse — BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Athena, or Databricks.
- Report at the grain you need: ad, ad set, or campaign.
- Split performance by age, gender, country, device, placement, URL asset, product, or region.
- Pull ad account, ad, and creative metadata alongside the numbers.
- Backfill history in runs of up to 31 days, then schedule the connector once and let it run.
- Run it on your own infrastructure — open source under the MIT license.

## Prerequisites

- An active [Meta Business account](https://business.facebook.com/).
- A Facebook ad account with Admin, Advertiser, or Analyst access.
- An OWOX Data Marts storage.

See the OWOX guide to [add a storage](https://docs.owox.com/docs/storages/manage-storages/#adding-a-new-storage).

If you create your first connector, read the OWOX guide to [create a connector-based Data Mart](https://docs.owox.com/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart/).
