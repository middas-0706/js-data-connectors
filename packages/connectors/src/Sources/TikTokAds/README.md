# TikTok Ads Source

Use this connector to import TikTok Ads data into your data warehouse.

You can:

- Land raw TikTok Ads data in your own warehouse — BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Athena, or Databricks.
- Report at the grain you need: advertiser, campaign, ad group, or ad.
- Break daily performance down by country.
- Pull campaign, ad group, ad, and custom audience metadata alongside the numbers.
- Backfill history in runs of up to 31 days, then schedule the connector once and let it run.

## Prerequisites

- A [TikTok for Business](https://ads.tiktok.com/) account.
- A TikTok advertiser account you can access.
- An OWOX Data Marts storage.

Connect with OAuth, or with an access token from your own TikTok developer app. See [Credentials](CREDENTIALS.md).

See the OWOX guide to [add a storage](https://docs.owox.com/docs/storages/manage-storages/#adding-a-new-storage).

If you create your first connector, read the OWOX guide to [create a connector-based Data Mart](https://docs.owox.com/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart/).

## Choose a Reporting Grain

**Data Level** sets the reporting grain for the two performance endpoints. Choose it before
you select fields. The field selector pins the matching unique-key fields, so rows merge
correctly. The default is `AUCTION_AD`.

> ⚠️ Do not change **Data Level** after a run has loaded data into a table. New rows would
> merge on a different key structure. Use a new Data Mart or a new destination table instead.

For the unique keys per level, see [Endpoints and Fields](ENDPOINTS_AND_FIELDS.md#data-level-and-unique-keys).
