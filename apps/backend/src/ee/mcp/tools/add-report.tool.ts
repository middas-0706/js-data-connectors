Create one report per user request, then change it with update_report when the user asks to add a filter, sort, aggregation, or rename it — do not create another report for the same data: the tool refuses a report whose fields duplicate one you already created on this data mart and destination (error_code similar_report_exists). For push destinations, the new report runs immediately by default: this starts one billed Report Run and delivers data, then initial_run returns the run_id to poll with get_report_run_status. Set run_immediately=false only when the user explicitly wants to create configuration without delivering data, such as before adding a schedule. Every destination type accepts the same optional output controls as query_data_mart — filters, slices, aggregations, date_buckets, sort — applied on each run: when the user asks to export numbers they saw in a query, copy those parameters verbatim from that query so the report matches what they saw. Google Sheets: a new Google Sheet is created automatically (an external Google Drive side effect) and linked to the report; pass spreadsheet_id to add the report as a sheet of an existing spreadsheet instead, so several related exports share one document.
