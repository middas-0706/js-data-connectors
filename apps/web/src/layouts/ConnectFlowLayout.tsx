 * Minimal, chrome-free layout for quick single-purpose "connect X" flows opened directly
 * from an external link — not tied to any one integration surface (the MCP add_destination
 * tool links here today, but the same pattern fits an Excel add-in, a Google Sheets add-on,
 * or any other client that needs a fast, focused setup page). Still fully authenticated and
 * project-scoped — reuses the exact same guard chain as MainLayout via ProjectAuthGuards —
 * just without the sidebar/nav chrome. Reuse this for future connect-flow pages rather than
 * adding more one-off layouts.
