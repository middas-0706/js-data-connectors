# Import Data from Facebook Ads

Use this guide to create a Facebook Ads Data Mart.

## Before You Start

Check these items before you create the Data Mart:

- You have set up [OWOX Data Marts](https://docs.owox.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start/).
- You have an [OWOX storage](https://docs.owox.com/docs/storages/manage-storages/#adding-a-new-storage), or you create one during setup.
- You can access the target ad account in [Meta Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage/accounts).
- You know the numeric [Facebook Account ID](#set-up-the-connector).
- You chose an authentication method in [Credentials](CREDENTIALS.md).

For a general connector walkthrough, see [Connector-based Data Mart](https://docs.owox.com/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart/).

## Create the Data Mart

1. Click **New Data Mart**.
2. Enter a title.
3. Select a storage.
4. Click **Create Data Mart**.

If you have no storage yet, choose **Create new storage** in the **Storage** dropdown, then pick a storage type. You can add its settings later. The Data Mart cannot publish until the storage settings are valid.

## Set Up the Connector

1. In **Input Source**, set **Definition Type** to **Connector**.
2. Choose **Facebook Ads**.
3. Choose your authentication method.

For OAuth, click **Continue with Facebook**, then sign in with a Facebook user who can access the ad account. If the button does not appear, use the **Access Token** method.

For manual authentication, fill in these fields:

- **Access Token**: paste the token from [Credentials](CREDENTIALS.md).
- **App ID**: enter your Meta App ID.
- **App Secret**: enter your Meta App Secret.

Then fill in **Account IDs**. Use numeric ad account IDs only, without the `act_` prefix. You can find the ID in [Meta Ads Manager](https://adsmanager.facebook.com/adsmanager/manage/accounts) under **Account Overview**. To import from multiple accounts, separate IDs with commas or semicolons. The authorized Facebook user must access every listed account.

## Configure Data Import

1. Choose an endpoint. Each Data Mart imports one endpoint, so create another Data Mart for each additional endpoint.
2. Select fields, or keep the defaults.
3. Enter the target dataset, or keep the default. The connector names each table after its endpoint, for example `facebook_ads_ad_account_insights`.
4. Click **Finish**.
5. Click **Publish & Run Data Mart**. The first run imports from the first day of the previous month and can take several minutes.

The connector writes its tables into your storage. The field label depends on your storage, such as **Dataset** for BigQuery or **Database** for Amazon Redshift. For your storage, see [Supported Storages](https://docs.owox.com/docs/storages/supported-storages/).

For spend, clicks, impressions, conversions, and ROAS, choose **Ad Account Insights**.

For endpoint details, see [Endpoints and Fields](ENDPOINTS_AND_FIELDS.md).

**Publish & Run Data Mart** stays inactive until your storage has valid settings. Open the storage, check its settings, then come back to this step. See [Storage Management](https://docs.owox.com/docs/storages/manage-storages/#adding-a-new-storage).

### Resolve Short Links

Facebook ads often point to short links. **Ad Account Insights by Link URL Asset** returns these short links in `link_url_asset.website_url`. OWOX can follow each short link and store the final landing page in `link_url_asset.parsed_url`.

To turn this on, keep the `link_url_asset` field selected and enable **Process Short Links** under **Advanced** settings. OWOX selects both by default for this endpoint. OWOX follows HTTP redirects only, so a short link that opens an interstitial page stays unresolved.

OWOX resolves standard short links, such as `https://bit.ly/abc123`, on any domain. OWOX treats links with several path parts, such as `https://links.example.com/abc/xyz`, as landing pages and leaves them unchanged.

If your short link service uses several path parts, enter its domain in **Short Link Domains**, for example `links.example.com`. You can also paste a full short link, such as `https://links.example.com/abc/xyz`, and OWOX keeps only the domain. Separate several entries with commas. OWOX then resolves links on these domains and their subdomains.

OWOX skips links with query parameters, such as `?utm_source=facebook`, because they already point to the landing page.

## Start a Manual Run

**Publish & Run Data Mart** already started the first import. Without a trigger, the Data Mart does not run again. To import again, click **Manual Run** and choose a run type, or set a trigger. See [schedule connector runs](https://docs.owox.com/docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-triggers/).

### Schedule Automatic Runs

1. Open the **Triggers** tab of your Data Mart.
2. Click **+ Add Trigger**.
3. Set **Trigger Type** to `Connector Run`.
4. Choose a schedule: **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Interval**.
5. Click **Save**.

### Incremental Load

Choose **Manual run → Incremental load**.

The first incremental run imports data from the first day of the previous month through today. Each successful incremental run saves the last requested date. Later runs start from that date minus **Reimport Lookback Window**. This lookback refreshes recently changed Facebook Ads metrics.

### Backfill

Choose **Backfill (custom period)** to import a specific date range.

1. Select **Start Date**.
2. Select **End Date**.
3. Click **Run**.

The import includes both the start date and the end date. One backfill run covers at most 31 days, so a full calendar month fits in one run. The form shows how many days your period covers and rejects a longer one before the run starts. To reload a longer history, run several backfills with consecutive periods. Start each run after the previous one finishes.

Both dates are required. The date picker does not offer future dates. The **End Date** must be on or after the **Start Date**.

## Check the Result

Open **Run history**. The run has finished when the status shows **Success**.

![Run history tab showing a successful Facebook Ads import](https://imagedelivery.net/zKr-4bdC5CBGL2DuuEmvYw/da9ea591-9924-4465-091b-90a65c827800/public)

You can query the imported tables in the dataset you selected. You can also send the data to a destination. See [Destination Management](https://docs.owox.com/docs/destinations/manage-destinations/) and [Google Sheets](https://docs.owox.com/docs/destinations/supported-destinations/google-sheets/).

## Troubleshooting

If a run fails, open **Run history**. Then match the Meta error with [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

For credential setup errors, see [Credentials](CREDENTIALS.md#troubleshooting-credential-setup).
