 *
 * These two answered the question separately once, and the copies disagreed:
 * the engine looked at `isTimeSeries` and the parser looked at `isTimeSeries`,
 * so a node that became time-series any other way got its date window but never
 * got the parameters that let a backfill supply one. Keeping the predicate here
 * means a change to what counts as time-series cannot land in one of them only.

 * Whether the node is processed as time-series — the flag

 *
 * A node qualifies by saying so outright (`isTimeSeries: true`) OR by declaring
 * a real date strategy. The second half is inference, and it exists because
 * requiring both spellings was a grammar our own first-party callers failed
 * independently: the no-code builder emits `incremental` and never writes
 * `isTimeSeries` (apps/web's PaginationIncremental.test.tsx pins that), and the
 * manifest reference's canonical example (§19.4) declares `day-by-day` without the word
 * `isTimeSeries` anywhere in it. Declaring a date strategy IS declaring that the
 * node is fetched by date; making the author repeat it under a second name only
 * created a way to write a manifest that reads as incremental and silently is
 * not — the request goes out with no window, a `{{ dateWindow.start }}` field is
 * written empty, and uniqueKeys built on that date collapse the import onto one
 * row, all while the run reports success.
 *
 * An explicit `isTimeSeries: false` does NOT veto the inference. `false` is the
 * absence-equivalent default, while `incremental: { strategy: 'day-by-day' }` is
 * a positive statement of intent, so the positive one wins.
 *
 * `isFullRefresh` is deliberately not consulted here. It is the other case where
 * two positive declarations contradict, and there the engine has no basis for
 * picking a winner — replacing the table wholesale and walking it one day at a
 * time are opposite intents. ManifestParser refuses that pairing outright rather
 * than resolving it silently; see the check next to the strategy validation.
 *
 * @param {object|undefined} node
 * @returns {boolean}
