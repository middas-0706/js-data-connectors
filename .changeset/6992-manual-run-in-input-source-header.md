**Start a connector run without expanding the Input Source card**

The **Manual Run** button of a connector Data Mart now sits in the header of the **Input Source** card on the **Data Setup** tab, next to the collapse arrow. Previously it was inside the card body, so a collapsed card hid it and you had to expand the card first, or find the run in the Data Mart's **⋮** menu. Now you can open a Data Mart from a failed-run email and start a new run straight away.

The video collapses the Input Source card and starts a run from its header:

- The button appears once the connector is configured.
- It stays disabled, with the reason in a tooltip, while the Data Mart is a draft or a run is in progress, as before.

See [Connector-based Data Mart](../../docs/getting-started/setup-guide/connector-data-mart.md) for running a connector manually.
