   * .getUniqueKeyByRecordFields) -- or, when the user did select ad_id, wrote a
   * null-filled key that collapsed every distinct row of a day into one.
   *
   * The hook is optional and duck-typed rather than an AbstractSource default,
   * so a source only pays for it when its keys really are config-dependent; a
   * source that declares nothing (all of them but TikTokAds today) keeps the
