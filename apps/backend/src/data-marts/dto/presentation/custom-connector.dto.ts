/**
 * Ceiling for a user-authored manifest.
 *
 * The binding constraint is the spawn, not storage. A stored manifest is handed to the connector
 * child process through the OW_MANIFEST environment variable (ConnectorProcessSpawnerService's
 * buildChildEnv and ConnectorTestService.runTest both JSON.stringify it), and Linux -- the
 * deployment target -- refuses a single env string longer than MAX_ARG_STRLEN, 32 * PAGE_SIZE =
 * 131072 bytes, measured across the whole `OW_MANIFEST=<json>` string plus its terminator. Past
 * that, every run of the connector dies at spawn with an opaque E2BIG, by which point it is
 * published and bound to a Data Mart. Bounding it here turns that into an actionable 400 while the
 * author is still writing the thing.
 *
 * 120 KiB keeps 8 KiB under the kernel ceiling, covering the variable name, the terminator, and the
 * separate total argv+envp budget that OW_CONFIG and OW_RUN_CONFIG share on the same spawn. It
 * refuses nothing realistic: the largest declarative manifest in this repo is 675 bytes, and the
 * most field-heavy node of any bundled connector (CriteoAds ad statistics, 156 fields) renders to
 * ~24 KiB with full descriptions -- so five nodes of that weight still fit.
 *
 * Exported because each service that can reach a spawn re-applies it at its own choke point --
 * ConnectorDefinitionService on create()/saveDraft(), ConnectorTestService on runTest().

/**
 * Ceilings for the rest of the create body, each keyed to the column the value lands in.
 *
 * The migration declares `name`, `title` and `docUrl` as `varchar` -- TypeORM's default length,
 * 255 -- and `description` and `logo` as `text`. On MySQL, the managed deployment's database, an
 * over-long value is ER_DATA_TOO_LONG (a 500) in strict mode and a SILENT TRUNCATION otherwise: a
 * clipped title, or a base64 logo cut mid-string and no longer an image. Nothing catches it
 * locally, because DbType is `sqlite | mysql` and SQLite ignores declared column lengths outright.
 *
 * The unit follows the column, and the two differ: MySQL counts VARCHAR(n) in CHARACTERS, which is
 * what `@MaxLength` measures, but caps TEXT at 65535 BYTES regardless of how many characters that
 * is -- so the text-backed fields need `@MaxByteLength`, or a description of multi-byte characters
 * would pass validation at up to three times the column's real capacity.
 *
 * The logo has a second reason to be bounded, which is why 64 KiB of base64 (comfortably a 256x256
 * icon) is a ceiling worth keeping rather than a formality: the list endpoint returns it inline for
 * every definition in the project, so an unbounded one is amplified across the whole list rather
 * than costing only its own record.
