## Contributing & Advanced Usage

This document is intended for contributors and advanced users who want to work on the OWOX Data Marts CLI locally, customize its behavior, or understand its internal structure.

If you're just looking to **get started quickly**, please refer to the [Quick Start guide](./README.md).

## Usage

<!-- usage -->

```sh-session
$ npm install -g owox
$ owox serve
Starting OWOX Data Marts...
Starting in production mode...
Starting server on port 3000...
$ owox --help
USAGE
  $ owox COMMAND

## Local Development: npm link

For local development and testing of this CLI, especially when it's not published to a public npm registry, you can use `npm link`. This command creates a symbolic link from your local package to the global npm directory, allowing you to run `owox` from any directory on your system as if it were globally installed.

### Using `npm link`

To link your local `owox` CLI globally, navigate to the `apps/owox` directory and execute:

```sh-session
npm link
```

After successfully linking, you can run `owox` commands from any directory:

```sh-session
owox serve --port 8080
```

### Using `npm unlink -g owox`

If you need to remove the global symbolic link to your local `owox` CLI, navigate to the `apps/owox` directory and execute:

```sh-session
npm unlink -g owox
```

This will remove the global link, and `owox` will no longer be accessible globally unless re-linked or installed through an npm registry.

## FAQ

This section explains the purpose of the files located in the `bin` directory of the CLI.

### Why are there files in the `bin` folder (`dev.cmd`, `run.js`, `dev.js`, `run.cmd`)? Why do some have a `.cmd` format?

The `bin` folder contains the executable entry points for your CLI. Their presence and format are designed to support different operating systems and operational modes (development/production).

- **`run.js` (and `run.cmd`)**: These are the primary "production" entry points for your CLI.

  - **`run.js`**: This is the main executable file for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS). The `#!/usr/bin/env node` (shebang) line at the beginning tells the operating system to execute this file using Node.js. This file launches the compiled version of your CLI (from the `dist` folder).
  - **`run.cmd`**: This is the equivalent of `run.js` for Windows operating systems. Windows does not understand shebangs, so a separate `.cmd` (or `.bat`) file is required to explicitly instruct the system to execute the Node.js script using the `node` interpreter.

- **`dev.js` (and `dev.cmd`)**: These are entry points specifically designed for **development**.
  - **`dev.js`**: This executable file is for Unix-based systems when running in development mode. Notice the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env -S node --loader ts-node/esm --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning`. This allows Node.js to run your TypeScript code **without prior compilation** by using the `ts-node/esm` loader. This significantly speeds up development as you don't need to wait for compilation every time you make changes. The `development: true` flag is passed to `@oclif/core` to enable development-specific features.
  - **`dev.cmd`**: This is the Windows equivalent of `dev.js`, also used for running in development mode with `ts-node/esm`.

In summary, the `.cmd` files ensure compatibility with Windows, while the `run` and `dev` pairs provide distinct entry points for the "production-ready" (compiled) CLI version and the active development version (directly from TypeScript source files).
