# Reports no longer deliver duplicate rows when no aggregation was chosen

A report with an explicit column selection and no aggregation, date bucket, or Unique Count set anywhere used to deliver every underlying row — most visibly from a join that fans one source row out across many. OWOX now collapses it on delivery.

**Two things to check before upgrading.** An automatically aggregated column is relabelled exactly as a manually chosen one always has been — `sessions` becomes `sessions | SUM` — so a Google Sheets formula or Looker Studio binding that reads the plain `sessions` header stops resolving. And a Data Mart defined by SQL now counts as having output controls, which materialises its definition as a view (`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`) on every run and on every Generated SQL preview: a **read-only storage credential that worked before will now fail**.

Watch a report that sets no aggregation get one applied, and the query it will actually run.

What a report gets depends on what it selected:

- Dimensions only — returned **distinct**. Nothing is renamed and no value can change.
- A metric among them — the **first aggregation that Data Mart's governance allows**, in priority order: `SUM` → `AVG` → `MIN` → `MAX` for numbers, `MIN` → `MAX` for dates and times. A boolean metric is left alone, and so is a text metric under its default governance; explicitly allowing `MIN` or `MAX` on a text field opts it back in.
- A row-level calculated formula — **recomputed at group level** when OWOX can prove that returns the same value, so `{{revenue}} / {{cost}}` becomes the ratio of the totals rather than an average of per-row ratios. One it cannot prove stays a grouping key rather than being guessed at.
- A column from a joined Data Mart — left alone entirely, because grouping by a joined metric would move its total.

The report editor fills the choice in for you rather than only predicting it: open a report that sets no aggregation and the function is already ticked on the column, counted on the **Aggregations** button, and listed in the panel — exactly as one you picked yourself, and changed or removed the same way. While the choice is fresh, a note names the columns OWOX chose for; once the report is saved the rule is simply yours, like any other. Pressing **Save** is enough to store it, and removing it leaves a note saying what delivery will still do — an unaggregated report on these destinations is collapsed either way. Run history records what was applied.

Ad-hoc reads are unchanged: **HTTP Data**, the MCP `query_data_mart` tool, `apps/ctl`, the Looker Studio cache-fill query, "copy as Data Mart", and a report's save-time dry run all keep returning exactly what was asked for, duplicates included — including pulling somebody's Google Sheets report over HTTP Data, where the caller is a third party rather than the report's reader. The two pull destinations part ways: a **Microsoft Excel** report collapses like every other report, because the add-in fetches the very rows it writes into the workbook, while a **Looker Studio** report stays uncollapsed, because its connector reads the report the way any other ad-hoc caller does. See [Report Aggregations](../../docs/getting-started/setup-guide/report-aggregations.md) for the full list of cases where a report is deliberately left uncollapsed.
