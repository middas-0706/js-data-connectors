# Reports

A **Report** delivers a Data Mart's output to a Destination — for example, a Google Sheets tab. Reports are how business users consume the data that analysts prepare.

## What Reports do in OWOX

A Report connects one [Data Mart](../data-marts/) to one [Destination](../destinations/). Business users get fresh, trusted data in the tool they already use. Analysts keep control over the query logic behind it.

Reports move data in two modes:

- **Push mode** — OWOX delivers [Data Mart](../data-marts/) data to the Destination on a manual or scheduled run. Google Sheets, Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Chat work this way.
- **Pull mode** — the Destination asks OWOX for the data when a user opens or refreshes it, and OWOX reads the [Storage](../storages/). Data Studio and Excel work this way.

## How Reports fit the workflow

[Sources](../connectors/) fill a [Storage](../storages/), Data Marts define business-ready data on top of it, and Reports publish that data to Destinations. A Report is the last step of the OWOX Data Marts workflow.

Each Report belongs to one Data Mart and one Destination. One Data Mart can have many Reports with different schedules.

## When to use Reports

- Business users need current numbers in Google Sheets without asking an analyst.
- A dashboard should refresh on a schedule instead of manual exports.
- Different teams need the same Data Mart in different tools or tabs.
- You want to deliver data to Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Google Chat.

## Get started

1. Publish a [Data Mart](../data-marts/).
2. [Add a Destination](../destinations/) for the tool your team uses.
3. On the Data Mart page, create a Report and pick that Destination.
4. Add a [Report Trigger](../getting-started/setup-guide/report-triggers.md) to refresh it on a schedule.

Pull-based Destinations work differently. For Data Studio, turn on the **Available in Data Studio** switch instead of creating a Report. Excel reports are created in the Excel add-in. You cannot schedule either one — the tool reads the data itself.
