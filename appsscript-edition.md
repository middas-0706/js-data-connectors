## ✨ Why We Built This

We believe every **data analyst should have the power to automate data collection** — without begging for engineering help, paying for expensive SaaS tools, or exposing credentials to 3rd party SaaS tools.
We want to empower **every business to become data owners** by importing their data into Spreadsheets or data warehouses.

OWOX Data Marts - Apps Script Edition is a growing library of JavaScript **connectors** that:

- Run inside **YOUR** Google Sheet
- Import data to **YOUR** Google Sheets ot Google BigQuery
- Require **no external platforms** or credentials sharing
- Doesn't require **ANY data engineering resources**
- Are 100% open-source and **customizable**
- **Free forever**: your connector - your control

Whether you're an analyst at an agency, a startup, or in a huge enterprise, this project gives you **full control over your data collection connectors**.

-----------

We also have **Node.js Community Edition** to avoid the Apps Script limitations already available.
See our [🚀 Quick Start setup docs](docs/getting-started/quick-start.md).
